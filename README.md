# Visualizing Behavior of Distributed Network Protocols using UPPAAL Simulations

If you load a UPPAAL model for a distributed network protocol into this application, you can get useful insight of what going on in the protocol over time. 
The parameters that make sense to configure should be prefixed with CONFIG_
The variables that makes sense to observe during simulations should be prefixed with OUTPUT_

This tool is work in process, developed as part of a master thesis on Aalborg University.
